#### Example config
```
{
  "bridge": {
    "name": "Homebridge",
    "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30",
    "port": 51826,
    "pin": "031-45-154"
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Landroid",
      "landroids": [
        {
          "name": "My Landroid",
          "email": "my@email.com",
          "pwd": "my_password",
          "dev_sel": 0,
          "issue": "contact"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Options
 - `name` Name for your Landroid to appear in HomeKit
 - `email` eMail for your Worx account
 - `pwd` password for your Worx account
 - `dev_sel` device number if you have more than one Landroid, default `0`
 - `issue` display issues with the mower as `contact` or `occupancy` sensor, default is `contact`

## Usage
The mower will appear as a switch and a contact / occupancy sensor in HomeKit.

#### On/Off Switch
The switch shows the current status and allows to control the mower. If the switch is off the mower is either on the home base or on its way to the home base. If it's on the mower is currently mowing. Turn the switch on to start the mowing cycle, turn it off to send the mower back home.

#### Contact or Occupancy Sensor
The contact sensor is used to display issues with the mower (trapped, outside wire etc.), when the contact sensor is "open" (occupancy is "detected") there is some issue that prevents the mower from continuing. Fix the issue to control the mower again.

#### Battery Status
You can see the battery status in the settings of either the switch or contact / occupancy sensor in the Home app and you can ask Siri about the battery status of your lawn mower.
